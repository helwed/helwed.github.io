The Beldeko (Belgisches Deutschkorpus) Summary Corpus is a learner corpus that consists of summaries written by advanced L2 German learners (CEF level B2-C1) with L1 Dutch. It has been created with the aim of investigating the academic writing skills in L2 German of third-year students of two bachelor programmes in Applied Linguistics and Linguistics and Literature, respectively. The corpus consists of 301 summaries (70774 tokens) written by 115 students of three intact classes (convenience sampling).
