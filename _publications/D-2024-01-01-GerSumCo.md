The GerSumCo (German Summary Corpus) is a learner corpus comprising syntheses written by L2 German writers (CEFR B2/C1) and writers of L1 German. The corpus has been created with the objective of conducting a comparative analysis of the academic writing of L1 German and L2 German students.  The two subcorpora (L1 and L2) contain a total of 286 texts (178 L1 and 108 L2), written by 286 students at 14 universities and language schools in Germany (Bamberg, Bochum, Dresden, Hamburg, Hildesheim, Kiel, Leipzig, Magdeburg, Osnabr√ºck, Potsdam, Trier, Wuppertal), Poland (Gdansk) and China (Hangzhou). The texts were collected between 2022 and 2024 as part of a PhD research project about a contrastive interlanguage analysis using GerSumCo and Beldeko to identify L1-dependent features in cohesion in L2/L1 German.
