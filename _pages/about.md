Hi, I am Helena! I am a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Antwerp, Belgium!

**Who am I?** After graduating in linguistics with a focus on computational linguistics in 2019, I used the last few years to first explore the industry while working at the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS), where I was able to develop skills in client communication, business proposal writing, and (agile) project management. After one year, I continued my academic career as a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow in Antwerp, Belgium. As a Pre-doctoral Research Fellow, I am currently enlarging my knowledge about corpus linguistics, natural language processing (NLP), statistical methods, academic writing, (academic) project management, and conference presentations.
