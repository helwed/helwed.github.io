**Abstract**

Second language (L2) writers struggle with cohesion (Crossley & McNamara, 2012). One reason is their tendency to rely on native language (L1) strategies for creating cohesive texts, which may differ from strategies in the L2 (Breindl, 2016). In contrast to the growing research into L1 transfer in cohesion in L2 English (e.g., Crossley & McNamara, 2011, 2012; Lu & Ai, 2015), research into this aspect of L2 German has been scarce to date (e.g., Belz, 2005; Breindl, 2016). We lack studies that contrast L2 texts produced by homogeneous L1 groups with those produced by diverse L1 groups. This specific comparison is of importance since, according to Jarvis (2000), establishing L1 transfer requires meeting the conditions of intra-L1-group homogeneity and inter-L1-group heterogeneity.

Using Jarvis's (2000) model, our study aims to fill this gap by performing a contrastive analysis of connectives in L2 German. We compare texts written by L2 German writers with L1 Dutch and texts written by L2 German writers with diverse L1s. The analysis is based on the Belgisches Deutschkorpus (Beldeko) (Wedig & Strobl, 2023) and the German Summary Corpus (GerSumCo). Beldeko contains 301 L2 German texts produced by L1 Dutch writers, while GerSumCo contains 100 L2 German texts produced by writers with diverse L1s. Both corpora consist of summaries of the same source texts that were produced under comparable conditions. The texts were manually annotated by three trained (near-)native annotators using our own guidelines. Preliminary results indicate L1 Dutch-dependent preferences for specific connectives (e.g., zuerst 'first'). Based on previous research, we expect to additionally find different densities and distributions of connectives depending on the writers' L1s (as observed in Breindl, 2016). Our presentation will cover the results of our first contrastive analysis of connective use, examining patterns in light of intra-L1-group homogeneity and inter-L1-group heterogeneity.
